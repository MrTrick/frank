<b>2.1 COPYING FILES</b>
<tt>cp (copy)</tt>

<i>cp file1 file2</i> is the command which makes a copy of file1 in the current working directory and calls it file2

What we are going to do now, is to take a file stored in an open access area of the file system, and use the cp command to copy it to your stuff directory.

First, cd to your stuff directory.
cd stuff

Then at the prompt, type, 
<i>cp /tmp/test.txt .</i>

Note: Don't forget the dot . at the end. Remember, the dot means the current directory.
The above command means copy the file test.txt to the current directory, keeping the name the same.

(Note: The directory /tmp is an area to which every user has read and write access.

Now, type
<i>cp test.txt test.bak</i>

This will copy the test.txt file already in your current directory, and name the new copy test.bak.
Do you remember how to list those files?
