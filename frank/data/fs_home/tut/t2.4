<b>2.4 SEARCHING</b>
<tt>find command</tt>

Often there are many files on a computer, and finding the right one is difficult. 
The find command will help you.

In your home directory, type
<i>find</i>

This will list all files in the current directory, and list all files in any subdirectories.
How does it work? The find command allows you to recursively search through any directory, and return files that match your criteria.
This command is a little complicated, so we'll look up the help on this command:
<i>find --help</i>

As you can see, the usage is <i>file query folder</i>, and there are options. 

If you type <i>find -n=*test* /</i> you will return a list of all files and folders in the entire filesystem that match the pattern '*test*'

What does this mean? 
The character * is called a wildcard, and will match against none or more characters.
Another wildcard is the character ?, which will match exactly one character.
So ?ouse will match files like house and mouse, but not grouse... and *ouse will match all of them.
