<b>1.4 THE DIRECTORIES . AND ..</b>

In all directories, there are two special directories called (.) and (..)

<b>The current directory (.)</b>

(.) means the current directory, so typing <i>cd .</i> means stay where you are (the stuff directory).
(NOTE: there is a space between cd and the dot)

This may not seem very useful at first, but using (.) as the name of the current directory will save a lot of typing, as we shall see later in the tutorial.

<b>The parent directory (..)</b>

(..) means the parent of the current directory, so typing <i>cd ..</i> will take you one directory up the hierarchy (back to your home directory).

Note: typing cd with no argument always returns you to your home directory. This is very useful if you are lost in the file system.
