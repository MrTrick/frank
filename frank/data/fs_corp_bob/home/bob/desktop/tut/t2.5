<tt>Helping you help yourself...</tt>

At the prompt, type:
<i>help</i>

A list will be returned of all the standard commands on that computer.
These commands aren't always the same on every computer, so it is worth seeing if there are any new tools on each system you use.

To find more information about each command, you can type <i>help commandname</i>, or <i>commandname --help</i>.

Not all available commands are installed, though... some are just scattered around the file system.
If you go to the /tmp folder, and type <i>ls</i>, there is a file called hello. You may notice it is a different color to regular files.

If you type <i>hello</i>, you will get an error like 'command not found'.
Because hello is not a standard command, you cannot run it in the normal way.
Type 
<i>./hello</i> or 
<i>/tmp/hello<i>
and the command will work!

Standard commands can be run this way too, eg: <i>/bin/ls</i>
