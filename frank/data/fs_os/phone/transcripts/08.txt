"Hello, Bob speaking."
"Hi Bob, what state is the lab in right now?"
"A bit of a mess, to be honest. Somehow frank's monitor died over the weekend. I don't think it's anything malicious, but I'm checking through the logs right now."
"So, can we have a demonstration tomorrow?"
"Well, you'll have to get a monitor in here."
"Okay, but can you check first where the fault is? frank might have done something to the bios."
"Sure, I've got some good diagnostics stuff on my laptop."
"Make sure you don't break the separation! My manager would kill both of us if there were a containment break."
"Don't worry, everything is locked down properly-"
"And get it out of there before the demonstration!"
"Will do."
"I'll get you a monitor this afternoon if you need it, just let me know."
