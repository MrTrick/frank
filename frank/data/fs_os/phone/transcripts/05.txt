"Hi Phil, it's Bob from up in the AI research lab."
"Oh, yeah... how's that lab going? Any of the drywall fallen down?"
"No, nothing like that..."
"Right, so what can I do for you?"
"We need some better physical security. One of the financial people went in there to poke around, he could have caused a major security breach!"
"Oh-kay... so what sort of security?"
"Swipe cards or a locked door would be nice."
"Hmmm, do you have a capex?"
"No, do I need one?"
"frayed so."
"So what can you do in the meantime?"
"How about a big warning sticker? We can print some nice ones up on the printer your lab construction paid for."
"Actually, that'd be great!"
"Well, just send me the copy, and I'll have it printed and to you the next day."
"Thanks a bunch, I'll get right on it."
"No problem!"
