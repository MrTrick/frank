"Hello?"
"Seymour, have you got a minute?"
"Sure, what is it?"
"I can't access the lab from my computer any more. Have you changed anything?"
"Oh yes - I had to shut off the V?P?N? on the workstation."
"Errm, can I turn it back on?"
"That shouldn't be a problem - it was just a precaution while I ran some tests with alice"
"Cool.
*pause*
Uh, I'm at the workstation now, and I can't log in."
"Oh, sorry! I took the auto-login off as another precaution. Only the account I created can enable the V?P?N? again."
"...and those details are?"
"Oh! login as seymour, the password is {$SEYMOUR_PASSWORD}."
"Alright, thank you, I'm in!"
"Not a problem, I should have let you know."
"Anything else I need to know?"
"Oh, there is one thing. Since you hooked up the camera, be very careful about putting any security details where the camera might see them!"
"Huh? There's no text recognition programmed into alice or frank, isn't that a bit much?!"
"Just be careful..."
"Sure, okay."
"Anyway, I've got to go, I'll talk to you tomorrow."
"Okay, bye..."
