<b>1.0 DISPLAYING THE CONTENTS OF A FILE ON THE SCREEN</b>
<tt>cat (concatenate)</tt>

To display a file on the screen, type <i>cat filename</i>
The command cat can be used to display the contents of a file on the screen. 
If you type: <i>cat /tut/t1.0</i> this file is displayed.

A number of tutorials files exist, read through each of them with the cat command, like this:
<i>cat /tut/t1.1
cat /tut/t1.2
cat /tut/t1.3
cat /tut/t1.4
cat /tut/t1.5</i>
(there are more... can you find them?)
