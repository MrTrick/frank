<b>2.3 REMOVING FILES AND DIRECTORIES</b>
<tt>rm (remove)</tt>

To delete (remove) a file or folder, use the rm command. As an example, we are going to create a copy of the test.txt file then delete it.

Inside your stuff directory, type
<i>cp test.txt test.junk
ls
rm test.junk
ls

Similarly you can also use the rm command to remove a directory. Be careful not to delete anything important!!!
