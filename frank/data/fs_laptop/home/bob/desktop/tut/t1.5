<b>1.5 PATHNAMES</b>
<tt>pwd (print working directory)</tt>

Pathnames enable you to work out where you are in relation to the whole file-system. For example, to find out the absolute pathname of your home-directory, type cd to get back to your home-directory and then type 
<i>pwd</i>
The full pathname will look something like this -
/home/ee51vn

which means that ee51vn (your home directory) is in the home sub-directory, which is in the top-level root directory called " / " .

Use the commands cd, ls and pwd to explore the file system.

(Remember, if you get lost, type cd by itself to return to your home-directory)
