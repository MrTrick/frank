		<h3>What is this?</h3>
		FRANK is a text-based adventure/puzzle game, inspired by the classic genre. There is a twist, of course - your interface is that of a computer's command-line.
		<h3>Where am I? How did I get here? Who am I?</h3>
		As with many examples of the genre, there's not a lot of backstory initially available. Think of the start screen as analogous to "You wake up in a field, remembering nothing. A path leads away to the north."
		<h3>What do I do?</h3>
		Explore! There's a way to get out of almost every situation you find yourself in. And if you search closely enough, you'll find out what you need to continue.
		<h3>What on earth is a command-line?</h3>
		A command-line interface is a text-based interface to a computer.<br>
		If you've never used a command-line before, then FRANK will be a little more difficult, but not impossible! Type <i>cat /tut/t1.0</i> to start with.
		<h3>It's broken!</h3>
		If something seems broken, you can <a href="mailto:frank_admin at this domain">report it</a>.
